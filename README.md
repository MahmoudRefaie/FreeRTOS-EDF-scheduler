# Project Introduction
This is a project in the Udacity Advanced Embedded System nanodegree.

Earliest Deadline First (EDF) is a shecduling algorithm that adopts a dynamic priority-based preemptive scheduling policy, meaning that the priority of a task can change during its execution, and the processing of any task is interrupted by a request for any higher priority task.

# Project Requirements
In this project you are required to design an EDF scheduler based on FreeRTOS.

## Implement the required changes
The following thesis discusses how to implement an EDF scheduler using FreeRTOS:

"Implementation and Test of EDF and LLREFSchedulers in FreeRTOS".
- chapter 2 : "FreeRTOS Task Scheduling". This is an important chapter to build a profound base before starting the project.
- chapter 3 : "EDF Scheduler". This chapter is the main chapter you will use to implement the EDF scheduler using FreeRTOS.
Implement the changes mentioned in chapter 3.2.2 : "Implementation in FreeRTOS". The changes will be implemented in tasks.c source file only.

Inorder for the EDF scheduler to work correctly, you still need to implement some changes that are not mentioned in the thesis:
1. In the "prvIdleTask" function: Modify the idle task to keep it always the farest deadline"
2. In the "xTaskIncrementTick" function: In every tick increment, calculate the new task deadline and insert it in the correct position in the EDF ready list"
3. In the "xTaskIncrementTick" function: Make sure that as soon as a new task is available in the EDF ready list, a context switching should take place. Modify preemption way as any task with sooner deadline must preempt task with larger deadline instead of priority"

## Implement 4 tasks using EDF scheduler
Inorder to verify the EDF scheduler, you need to implement an application:
1. Create 4 tasks with the following criteria:

- Task 1: ""Button_1_Monitor"", {Periodicity: 50, Deadline: 50}
This task will monitor rising and falling edge on button 1 and send this event to the consumer task. (Note: The rising and failling edges are treated as separate events, hence they have separate strings)

- Task 2: ""Button_2_Monitor"", {Periodicity: 50, Deadline: 50}
This task will monitor rising and falling edge on button 2 and send this event to the consumer task. (Note: The rising and failling edges are treated as separate events, hence they have separate strings)

- Task 3: ""Periodic_Transmitter"", {Periodicity: 100, Deadline: 100}
This task will send preiodic string every 100ms to the consumer task

- Task 4: ""Uart_Receiver"", {Periodicity: 20, Deadline: 20}
This is the consumer task which will write on UART any received string from other tasks

2. Add a 5th and 6th task to simulate a heavier load:

- Task 5: ""Load_1_Simulation"", {Periodicity: 10, Deadline: 10}, Execution time: 5ms
- Task 6: ""Load_2_Simulation"", {Periodicity: 100, Deadline: 100}, Execution time: 12ms

These two tasks shall be implemented as en empty loop that loops X times. You shall determine the X times to achieve the required execution time mentioned above. (Hint: In run-time use GPIOs and logic analyzer to determine the execution time)"

## Verifying the system implementation
Now you should verify your system implementation with the EDF scheduler using the following methods:
1. Using analytical methods calculate the following for the given set of tasks:

- Calculate the system hyperperiod
- Calculate the CPU load
- Check system schedulability using URM and time demand analysis techniques (Assuming the given set of tasks are scheduled using a fixed priority rate -monotonic scheduler)

**Note**: For all the tasks you should calculate the execution time from the actual implemented tasks using GPIOs and the logic analyzer

2. Using Simso offline simulator, simulate the given set of tasks assuming: Fixed priority rate monotonic scheduler
3. Using Keil simulator in run-time and the given set of tasks: Calculate the CPU usage time using timer 1 and trace macros
4. Using trace macros and GPIOs, plot the execution of all tasks, tick, and the idle task on the logic analyzer"
